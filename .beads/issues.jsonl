The loaders (handler-loader.ts, seed-loader.ts) exist but are not called from the runner.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis (Discovered)\n\n**The implementation diverged completely from the PRD and PLAN specifications.**\n\n#### What Was Specified (PRD FR-004 + Scalar Docs):\n\n1. **Handler Format** - Object mapping operationId → JS code:\n   - **Static**: `operationId: \"JS code string\"` (literal code)\n   - **Dynamic**: `operationId: (context) =\u003e \"JS code string\"` (function that generates code based on OpenAPI context)\n\n2. **Seed Format** - Object mapping schemaName → JS code:\n   - **Static**: `schemaName: \"JS code string\"`\n   - **Dynamic**: `schemaName: (context) =\u003e \"JS code string\"`\n\n3. **Document Enhancer (P2-03)** - Inject x-handler/x-seed extensions into OpenAPI spec\n\n4. **Scalar Integration** - Pass enhanced spec to createMockServer(), Scalar executes x-handler/x-seed code automatically with helpers (store, faker, req, res, seed)\n\n#### What Was Implemented (Incorrectly):\n\n1. **Handler Format**: Single async function as default export that returns response directly\n2. **Seed Format**: Single async function as default export that returns data directly  \n3. **Document Enhancer**: NOT IMPLEMENTED\n4. **Scalar Integration**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Scalar receives plain spec without extensions\n\n### Scalar Mock Server Documentation\n\n- x-handler: https://scalar.com/products/mock-server/custom-request-handler\n- x-seed: https://scalar.com/products/mock-server/data-seeding\n\nScalar expects:\n- `x-handler`: JS code string in operation objects (paths[path][method]['x-handler'])\n- `x-seed`: JS code string in schema objects (components.schemas[name]['x-seed'])\n\n### Solution: Rewrite to Follow PRD (Option A)\n\n1. **Rewrite handler-loader.ts**:\n   - Load files that export objects: `{ operationId: string | ((ctx) =\u003e string) }`\n   - Support both static (string) and dynamic (function→string) formats\n   - Validate against OpenAPI operations\n\n2. **Rewrite seed-loader.ts**:\n   - Load files that export objects: `{ schemaName: string | ((ctx) =\u003e string) }`\n   - Support both static (string) and dynamic (function→string) formats\n   - Validate against OpenAPI schemas\n\n3. **Implement document-enhancer.ts (P2-03)**:\n   - Clone OpenAPI spec\n   - For each handler: resolve code (call function if dynamic), inject into operation['x-handler']\n   - For each seed: resolve code (call function if dynamic), inject into schema['x-seed']\n   - Return enhanced spec\n\n4. **Update runner**:\n   - Import and call loadHandlers(), loadSeeds()\n   - Call enhanceDocument() with loaded handlers/seeds\n   - Pass ENHANCED spec to createMockServer()\n\n### Files to Modify\n\n- packages/vite-plugin-open-api-server/src/loaders/handler-loader.ts (rewrite)\n- packages/vite-plugin-open-api-server/src/loaders/seed-loader.ts (rewrite)\n- packages/vite-plugin-open-api-server/src/enhancer/document-enhancer.ts (create - P2-03)\n- packages/vite-plugin-open-api-server/src/runner/openapi-server-runner.mts (integrate)\n- packages/vite-plugin-open-api-server/src/types/handlers.ts (update types)\n- packages/vite-plugin-open-api-server/src/types/seeds.ts (update types)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"miguel.m.ramos@mercedes-benz.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T16:28:42.904191Z","created_by":"Miguel Ramos","updated_at":"2026-01-16T12:49:27.595238Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T12:49:27.595238Z","close_reason":"Complete integration of handler/seed loaders into runner with document enhancement.
