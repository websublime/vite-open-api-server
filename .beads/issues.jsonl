Analyze PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS-SPECIFICATION.md to identify all functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015)\n2. Group related FRs into development phases/epics\n3. Break each epic into concrete implementation tasks and subtasks\n4. Map dependencies between tasks (what must be built first)\n5. Add effort estimates (T-shirt sizing or story points)\n6.
