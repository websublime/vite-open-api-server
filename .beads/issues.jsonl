This plan will:\n- Break down the 15 functional requirements into manageable epics and tasks\n- Define dependencies between components to ensure correct build order\n- Provide effort estimates for resource planning\n- Serve as the source for creating all bd issues to track development progress\n\n## HOW\n1. Analyze PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS-SPECIFICATION.md to identify all functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015)\n2. Group related FRs into development phases/epics\n3. Break each epic into concrete implementation tasks and subtasks\n4. Map dependencies between tasks (what must be built first)\n5. Add effort estimates (T-shirt sizing or story points)\n6. Define a suggested timeline/milestone structure\n7. Document in history/PLAN.md following project conventions","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T13:50:47.954606Z","created_by":"ramosmig","updated_at":"2026-01-08T13:59:21.031183Z"}
