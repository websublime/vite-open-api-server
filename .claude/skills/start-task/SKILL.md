# Start Task

Route a bead task through investigation and implementation. This is the orchestrator's main entry point for starting work on any bead.

---

## Phase 1: Resolve Bead ID

If the user provides `$ARGUMENTS`, check if it contains a bead ID (e.g., `bd-a3f`, `bd-001.2`).

**If bead ID provided:** use it directly.

**If no bead ID provided:**
1. Run `bd ready --json` to get unblocked tasks
2. Present the list to the user showing: ID, title, priority, and labels
3. Pick the task by order and priority, any doubt ask the user.

**Validate** the bead exists:
```bash
bd show {BEAD_ID} --json
```
If the bead does not exist, inform the user and stop.

---

## Phase 2: Read Full Bead Context

1. Parse the bead JSON output from Phase 1. Extract: `description`, `acceptance`, `design`, `notes`, `status`, `parent`, `labels`
2. **If bead is an epic child** (BEAD_ID contains a dot, e.g., `bd-001.2`):
   - Extract EPIC_ID: the part before the first dot (e.g., `bd-001`)
   - Read the epic: `bd show {EPIC_ID} --json`
   - Extract the design doc path from the epic if available
   - Read the design doc content — this is the implementation contract
3. Store all context for use in dispatch prompts

---

## Phase 3: Resolve Supervisor

1. Parse the `notes` field from the bead — look for a line matching `supervisor: {name}` (case-insensitive, trimmed)
2. **If `supervisor:` field found:**
   - Verify the agent file exists: check for `.claude/agents/{name}.md`
   - If file exists → supervisor resolved, proceed to Phase 4
   - If file NOT found → warn user that the specified supervisor does not exist, fall through to manual selection
3. **If `supervisor:` field NOT found** in notes, or the specified agent file does not exist:
   - List available implementation supervisors: find all `*-supervisor.md` files in `.claude/agents/`
   - Present the list to the user with agent names (without `.md` suffix)
   - Inform: "If the supervisor you need is not listed, you can create one with `/add-supervisor {technology}`."
   - Ask: "Which supervisor should handle this task? Or do you need to create a new one first?"
   - If user wants to create → stop and suggest running `/add-supervisor {tech}` first, then re-run `/start-task`
   - If user selects existing → supervisor resolved

---

## Phase 4: Investigation Check

1. Read bead comments: `bd comments {BEAD_ID}`
2. Search the comments for one containing the string `INVESTIGATION:`
3. **If no investigation found:**
   - Inform user: "No investigation found for this bead. I can dispatch the research agent to investigate first."
   - Ask user: "Do you want to proceed with investigation, or skip and dispatch directly to the supervisor?"
   - **If user wants investigation** → dispatch research agent:
     ```python
     Task(
         subagent_type="research",
         prompt="Investigate BEAD {BEAD_ID}. Description: {description}. Acceptance criteria: {acceptance}. Design notes: {design}. [Include epic design doc content if this is an epic child]. Log your structured findings as a bead comment using bd comments add."
     )
     ```
   - Wait for the research agent to complete before proceeding to Phase 5
   - **If user wants to skip** → proceed directly to Phase 5
4. **If investigation already exists** → proceed directly to Phase 5

---

## Phase 5: Check for Existing Branch

Before dispatching, check if a branch already exists for this bead (e.g., from a previous NEEDS-REWORK cycle):

```bash
git branch -a | grep {BEAD_ID}
```

**If branch exists:**
- Inform user: "A branch already exists for this bead: `{branch-name}`. This may be from a previous implementation attempt."
- Ask user: "Do you want to continue on the existing branch, or create a fresh branch?"
- Include this context in the dispatch prompt so the supervisor knows whether to checkout the existing branch or create new

**If no branch exists:** proceed normally.

---

## Phase 6: Dispatch Implementation Supervisor

1. Build the dispatch prompt with complete context:
   - BEAD_ID (and EPIC_ID if this is an epic child)
   - Full description and acceptance criteria
   - Design notes
   - Reference to investigation: "Read bead comments (bd comments {BEAD_ID}) for investigation context before starting implementation."
   - Epic design doc reference if applicable

2. Dispatch the resolved supervisor:
   ```python
   Task(
       subagent_type="{resolved-supervisor}",
       prompt="Implement BEAD {BEAD_ID}. Description: {description}. Acceptance: {acceptance}. Design: {design}. Read bead comments (bd comments {BEAD_ID}) for investigation context before starting implementation."
   )
   ```

3. The `PreToolUse` hook automatically injects the discipline reminder because the agent name ends in `-supervisor`.
