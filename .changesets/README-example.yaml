# Example Changeset
#
# This is an example changeset file to help you understand the format.
# When you're ready to create real changesets, use: workspace changeset add
#
# Important: Changesets should be committed to git as part of your PR.
# They tell the CI/CD pipeline what version bumps to perform on merge.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Create a changeset: workspace changeset add
# 2. Commit it with your changes: git add .changesets/your-changeset.yaml
# 3. Push your branch: git push
# 4. When merged to main, CI runs: workspace bump --execute
# 5. Versions are bumped, changesets move to history/
#
